  abstract = {Background Frailty, social isolation, loneliness, and poverty may render older adults vulnerable to social or health stressors. It is imperative to identify effective interventions to address them especially in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To identify effective community-based interventions to address frailty, social isolation, loneliness, and poverty among community-dwelling older adults. Design Umbrella review. Data Source We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, EBM-Reviews, CINAHL via EBSCO, and APA PsycInfo via Ovid from January 2009 to December 2022. Eligibility Criteria We included systematic reviews or quantitative reviews of non-pharmacologic interventions targeting community-dwelling older adults. Data Selection, Extraction, and Management Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, performed data extraction and appraised the methodological quality of the reviews. We used a narrative synthesis approach to summarize and interpret the findings. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies using AMSTAR 2.0 tool. Results We identified 27 reviews incorporating 372 unique primary studies that met our inclusion criteria. Ten of the reviews included studies conducted in low-middle-income countries. Twelve reviews (46\%, 12/26) included interventions that addressed frailty. Seventeen reviews (65\%, 17/26) included interventions that addressed either social isolation or loneliness. Eighteen reviews included studies with single component interventions, while 23 reviews included studies with multi-component interventions. Interventions including protein supplementation combined with physical activity may improve outcomes including frailty status, grip strength, and body weight. Physical activity alone or in combination with diet may prevent frailty. Additionally, physical activity may improve social functioning and interventions using digital technologies may decrease social isolation and loneliness. We did not find any review of interventions addressing poverty among older adults. We also noted that few reviews addressed multiple vulnerabilities within the same study, specifically addressed vulnerability among ethnic and sexual minority groups, or examined interventions that engaged communities and adapted programs to local needs. Conclusion Evidence from reviews support diets, physical activity, and digital technologies to improve frailty, social isolation or loneliness. However, interventions examined were primarily conducted under optimal conditions. There is a need for further interventions in community settings and conducted under real world settings in older adults living with multiple vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- This paper aims to examine the impact of a firm's emotional capability on its performance by considering the environmental dynamism, and to enhance the literature on organizational change and competencies. Design/methodology/approach -- The study involves a questionnaire-based survey of managers and employees from a variety of firms operating in Turkey. A total of 356 surveys from 112 firms were received and subjected to moderated multiple hierarchical regression analyses. Findings -- The results show that firm emotional capability, which involves the dynamics of encouragement, displaying freedom, playfulness, experiencing, reconciliation, and identification constructs, has a significant effect on the firm's financial performance and organizational effectiveness. Further, that the relationship between emotional capability and firm performance was influenced by the environmental dynamism including changes in industry, competition and consumer. Research limitations/implications -- This study only scratched the surface in the important research area on emotional capability in organizational change management scholarship; hence this requires further empirical research. Practical implications -- This study helps managers to understand the role an organization's skill plays in the management of its employees' emotions in order to increase the firm's performance in changing environments. Originality/value -- The paper explores the emotional perspective of organizational capabilities on a firm's financial performance and organizational effectiveness to increase one's comprehension of successful capabilities-environment matching, and understanding of the capabilities of firms for continued and effective adaptation.}

While previous research indicates that supply chain complexity plays an important role in explaining performance outcomes, the accumulating evidence is ambiguous. Thus, a finer-grained analysis is required. By meta-analyzing 27,668 observations across 102 independent samples from 123 empirical studies, we examine the link between supply chain complexity and firm performance. While the preponderance of evidence from previous studies identifies supply chain complexity as detrimental to firm performance, our results illustrate that although supply chain complexity has a negative effect on operational performance, it has a positive effect on innovation performance and financial performance. Furthermore, we also distinguish among different levels of supply chain (i.e., upstream, downstream, and internal) and observe nuanced findings. Finally, our findings also reveal moderating effects of construct operationalization and study design characteristics. We discuss implications for theory and practice and provide avenues for future research.},

However, a key unresolved issue is whether employee perceptions of HR strength act as a mediator or a moderator in the relationship between HR practices and these outcomes. A meta-analysis of 42 studies (comprising 65 samples and 29,444 unique participants) was conducted to address this issue. Results support the mediating hypothesis for all five employee outcomes: employee reactions, proactive behavior, burnout, performance, and perceived organizational effectiveness. Conversely, the moderating hypothesis was only supported for employee performance. In addition, we examined five study characteristics (the operationalization of perceived HR strength, research study design, industry, sampling strategy, and publication status) as moderators. Using this analysis, we test the robustness of our main results and identify sources of heterogeneity in the results across studies. The results show that the mediating hypothesis still holds under different study designs and contexts. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Modern nosologies (e.g., ICD-11, DSM-5) for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and dependence prioritize reliability and clinical presentation over etiology, resulting in a diagnosis that is not always strongly grounded in basic theory and research. Within these nosologies, DSM-5 AUD is treated as a discrete, largely categorical, but graded, phenomenon, which results in additional challenges (e.g., significant phenotypic heterogeneity). Efforts to increase the compatibility between AUD diagnosis and modern conceptualizations of alcohol dependence, which describe it as dimensional and partially overlapping with other psychopathology (e.g., other substance use disorders) will inspire a stronger scientific framework and strengthen AUD's validity. We conducted a systematic review of 144 reviews to integrate addiction constructs and theories into a comprehensive framework with the aim of identifying fundamental mechanisms implicated in AUD. The product of this effort was the Etiologic, Theory-Based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical Framework (ETOH Framework) of AUD mechanisms, which outlines superdomains of cognitive control, reward, as well as negative valence and emotionality, each of which subsume narrower, hierarchically-organized components. We also outline opponent processes and self-awareness as key moderators of AUD mechanisms. In contrast with other frameworks, we recommend an increased conceptual role for negative valence and compulsion in AUD. The ETOH framework serves as a critical step towards conceptualizations of AUD as dimensional and heterogeneous. It has the potential to improve AUD assessment and aid in the development of evidence-based diagnostic measures that focus on key mechanisms in AUD, consequently facilitating treatment matching.},

Using a quantitative approach, we selected a random Crossref sample of more than 115,000 records, which was then searched in seven databases (Dimensions, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, OpenAlex, Scilit, Semantic Scholar, and The Lens). Seven characteristics were analyzed (abstract, access, bibliographic info, document type, publication date, language, and identifiers), to observe fields that describe this information, the completeness rate of these fields, and the agreement among databases. The results show that academic search engines (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Semantic Scholar) gather less information and have a low degree of completeness. Conversely, third-party databases (Dimensions, OpenAlex, Scilit, and The Lens) have more metadata quality and a higher completeness rate. We conclude that academic search engines lack the ability to retrieve reliable descriptive data by crawling the web, and the main problem of third-party databases is the loss of information derived from integrating different sources.}

Accordingly, 20 TER studies in PE and 31 in SE were identified to be reviewed systematically. Descriptive findings suggested a rise in TER studies. Quantitative methods were dominantly employed, and the majority were conducted in China. The conceptual focus of the studies highlighted two key areas: emotion regulation and emotional labour. The primary research focus was found to be affective factors in the workplace. The findings of conceptual analyses on the workplace outcomes revealed five themes at both levels, namely, leadership and management, organisational climate and support, cultural and diversity considerations, teacher development, and classroom and interaction dynamics consisting of similar and distinctive codes.},

  abstract = {Background Road Traffic injuries (RTI) are among the top ten leading causes of death in the world resulting in 1.35 million deaths every year, about 93\% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite several global resolutions to reduce traffic injuries, they have continued to grow in many countries. Many high-income countries have successfully reduced RTI by using a public health approach and implementing evidence-based interventions. As many LMICs develop their highway infrastructure, adopting a similar scientific approach towards road safety is crucial. The evidence also needs to be evaluated to assess external validity because measures that have worked in high-income countries may not translate equally well to other contexts. An evidence gap map for RTI is the first step towards understanding what evidence is available, from where, and the key gaps in knowledge. Objectives The objective of this evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing evidence from all effectiveness studies and systematic reviews related to road safety interventions. In addition, the EGM identifies gaps in evidence where new primary studies and systematic reviews could add value. This will help direct future research and discussions based on systematic evidence towards the approaches and interventions which are most effective in the road safety sector. This could enable the generation of evidence for informing policy at global, regional or national levels. Search Methods The EGM includes systematic reviews and impact evaluations assessing the effect of interventions for RTI reported in academic databases, organization websites, and grey literature sources. The studies were searched up to December 2019. Selection Criteria The interventions were divided into five broad categories: (a) human factors (e.g., enforcement or road user education), (b) road design, infrastructure and traffic control, (c) legal and institutional framework, (d) post-crash pre-hospital care, and (e) vehicle factors (except car design for occupant protection) and protective devices. Included studies reported two primary outcomes: fatal crashes and non-fatal injury crashes; and four intermediate outcomes: change in use of seat belts, change in use of helmets, change in speed, and change in alcohol/drug use. Studies were excluded if they did not report injury or fatality as one of the outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis The EGM is presented in the form of a matrix with two primary dimensions: interventions (rows) and outcomes (columns). Additional dimensions are country income groups, region, quality level for systematic reviews, type of study design used (e.g., case-control), type of road user studied (e.g., pedestrian, cyclists), age groups, and road type. The EGM is available online where the matrix of interventions and outcomes can be filtered by one or more dimensions. The webpage includes a bibliography of the selected studies and titles and abstracts available for preview. Quality appraisal for systematic reviews was conducted using a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, AMSTAR 2. Main Results The EGM identified 1859 studies of which 322 were systematic reviews, 7 were protocol studies and 1530 were impact evaluations. Some studies included more than one intervention, outcome, study method, or study region. The studies were distributed among intervention categories as: human factors (n = 771), road design, infrastructure and traffic control (n = 661), legal and institutional framework (n = 424), post-crash pre-hospital care (n = 118) and vehicle factors and protective devices (n = 111). Fatal crashes as outcomes were reported in 1414 records and non-fatal injury crashes in 1252 records. Among the four intermediate outcomes, speed was most commonly reported (n = 298) followed by alcohol (n = 206), use of seatbelts (n = 167), and use of helmets (n = 66). Ninety-six percent of the studies were reported from high-income countries (HIC), 4.5\% from upper-middle-income countries, and only 1.4\% from lower-middle and low-income countries. There were 25 systematic reviews of high quality, 4 of moderate quality, and 293 of low quality. Authors' Conclusions The EGM shows that the distribution of available road safety evidence is skewed across the world. A vast majority of the literature is from HICs. In contrast, only a small fraction of the literature reports on the many LMICs that are fast expanding their road infrastructure, experiencing rapid changes in traffic patterns, and witnessing growth in road injuries. This bias in literature explains why many interventions that are of high importance in the context of LMICs remain poorly studied. Besides, many interventions that have been tested only in HICs may not work equally effectively in LMICs. Another important finding was that a large majority of systematic reviews are of low quality. The scarcity of evidence on many important interventions and lack of good quality evidence-synthesis have significant implications for future road safety research and practice in LMICs. The EGM presented here will help identify priority areas for researchers, while directing practitioners and policy makers towards proven interventions.},

The COVID-19 pandemic shows us the boundaries of academic searching capabilities, both in terms of our know-how and of the systems we have. With hundreds of studies published daily on COVID-19, for example, we struggle to find, stay up-to-date, and synthesize information---all hampering evidence-informed decision making. This COVID-19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the ``Search Triangle'' model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit-for-purpose search systems.},

Therefore, this study evaluates the citation coverage of the citation indices of 59 databases, encompassing the widely used Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science alongside many others never previously analyzed, such as the emerging Lens, Scite, Dimensions, and OpenAlex or the subject-specific PubMed and JSTOR. Through a comprehensive analysis using 259 journal articles from across disciplines, this research aims to guide scholars in selecting indices with broader document coverage and more accurate and comprehensive backward and forward citation links. Key findings highlight Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Semantic Scholar, and Lens as leading options for FWC searching, with Lens providing superior download capabilities. For BWC searching, the Web of Science Core Collection can be recommended over Scopus for accuracy. BWC information from publisher databases such as IEEE Xplore or ScienceDirect was generally found to be the most accurate, yet only available for a limited number of articles. The findings will help scholars conducting systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and bibliometric analyses to select the most suitable databases for citation searching.},

To improve literature sampling, we have developed a guide that details four sequenced and prioritized scoping, searching, screening, and reporting steps. The guide also includes recommendations for the most suitable literature databases to search with, suggested (AI-enabled) tool support, and two checks to validate the effectiveness of search strategies. We created this guide by adapting the state-of-the-art recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA---the widely acknowledged benchmarks in methodical and reporting guidance---and supplementing them with additional evidence-based methodological insights. By adopting the guide, authors can ensure their sampling is effective and meets the high standards of SLRs and MAs, thereby likely boosting the impact of their review. The guide is applicable to all review types that require comprehensive, transparent, and reproducible sampling, including bibliometric studies and integrative reviews.},

  abstract = {Rigorous evidence identification is essential for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (evidence syntheses), because the sample selection of relevant studies determines a review's outcome, validity, and explanatory power. Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analysed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognise the requirements of evidence synthesis, and for academic journals to re-assess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to reviewing literature may be susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a `critical friend' role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the `systematic review' label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions.},

Rigorous searching methods are vital for reliable, repeatable and unbiased searches needed for these second and third forms of searches (exploratory and systematic searching, respectively) that form a core part of evidence syntheses. Despite the broad awareness of the importance of transparency in reporting search activities in evidence syntheses, the importance of searching has been highlighted only recently and has been the explicit focus of reporting guidance (PRISMA-S). Ensuring bibliographic searches are reported in a way that is transparent enough to allow for full repeatability or evaluation is challenging for a number of reasons. Here, we detail these reasons and provide for the first time a standardised data structure for transparent and comprehensive reporting of search histories. This data structure was produced by a group of international experts in informatics and library sciences. We explain how the data structure was produced and describe its components in detail. We also demonstrate its practical applicability in tools designed to support literature review authors and explain how it can help to improve interoperability across tools used to manage literature reviews. We call on the research community and developers of reference and review management tools to embrace the data structure to facilitate adequate reporting of academic searching in an effort to raise the standard of evidence syntheses globally.},

  abstract = {Literature reviews are conducted for a range of purposes, from providing an overview or primer of a novel topic, to providing a comprehensive, precise, and accurate estimate of an effect estimate. There is much confusion over nomenclature related to literature reviews, with the term `systematic review' often used to mean any review based on some form of explicit methodology. However, guidance and minimum standards exist for these kinds of robust reviews that are intended to support evidence-informed decision-making, and reviewers must carefully ensure their syntheses are conducted and reported to a high standard if this is their objective. The diversity of names given to reviews is reflected in the diversity of methods used for these evidence syntheses: the result is a general confusion about what is important to ensure a review is fit-for-purpose, and many reviews are labelled as `systematic reviews' when they do not follow standardised or replicable approaches. Here, we provide a glossary or typology that aims to highlight the importance of the reviewers' objectives in choosing and naming their review method. We focus on reviews in public health and provide guidance on selecting an objective, methodological guidance to follow, justifying and reporting the methods chosen, and attempting to ensure consistent and clear nomenclature. We hope this will help review authors, editors, peer-reviewers, and readers understand, interpret, and critique a review depending on its intended use. \copyright{} Author(s) 2022.},

  abstract = {As critical urban infrastructure, railways are highly vulnerable to climate hazards intensified by climate change. However, awareness of these risks is low, and comprehensive studies outlining these hazards and their impacts on railways are also scarce. To address these gaps, this review aims to identify climate-related risks, clarify the hazard-impact relationships and risk interconnections, and explore strategies to account for the influence of climate change on these risks. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted in two stages. First, 71 peer-reviewed papers were collected through developing search strings, applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and performing backward/forward citation searches. Second, the required information was systematically extracted from the papers and critically analyzed to address the research objectives. As a result, 24 climate hazards and 29 associated impacts were identified and categorized. The hazards and impacts having the most and least occurrence in the literature were also highlighted. Informative matrices were developed to correlate hazards with impacts and illustrate the cascading effects of the impacts. Four distinct approaches used to address the effects of climate change on climate risks were identified and critically discussed. The study also highlights critical gaps in the literature to guide future research.}

Beyond the traditional study of their perceptions and attitudes, they are also active agents whose behaviours influence the image of the destination and the satisfaction of tourists. To date, some outstanding works have reviewed the existing literature on residents' perceptions of tourism impacts and residents' attitudes toward tourism. However, no other review studies have addressed the resident pro-tourism behaviour issue with the specific aim of developing a conceptual framework. This study aims to address this gap through a systematic review (following the PRISMA protocol) to identify and classify residents' behaviours towards tourism and, to analyse the scales used to measure these behaviours. Theoretical insights from the results include: a classification of residents' pro-tourism behaviours; a focus on measuring active, favourable behaviours, with varying emphasis on other specific behaviours; and a merely testimonial presence of quantitative studies measuring anti-tourism behaviours. From a practical standpoint, tourism managers should recognise that residents' behaviours toward tourism can vary depending on the destination and the degree of resident-tourist interaction. From a social perspective, understanding residents' behaviour is essential for achieving balanced and sustainable tourism development.},

Search systems require several essential attributes to support systematic searching; however, many systems used in evidence synthesis fail to meet one or more of these requirements. I undertook a qualitative study to examine the effects of these limitations on systematic searching and how searchers select information sources for evidence synthesis projects. Methods: Qualitative data were collected from interviews with twelve systematic searchers. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: I used thematic analysis to identify two key themes relating to search systems: systems shape search processes, and systematic searching occurs within the information market. Many systems required for systematic reviews, in particular sources of unpublished studies, are not designed for systematic searching. Participants described various workarounds for the limitations they encounter in these systems. Economic factors influence searchers' selection of sources to search, as well as the degree to which vendors prioritize these users. Conclusion: Interviews with systematic searchers suggest priorities for improving search systems, and barriers to improvement that must be overcome. Vendors must understand the unique requirements of systematic searching and recognize systematic searchers as a distinct group of users. Better interfaces and improved functionality will result in more efficient evidence synthesis.},

Using this list as the framework for a targeted comparison between just GS and PubMed, we found stark differences which overwhelmingly favored PubMed. In this comment, we show that by comparing the characteristics of the two search tools, features that are particularly useful in one search tool, but are missing in the other, are strikingly spotlighted. One especially popular feature that ubiquitously appears in GS, but not in PubMed, is the forward citation search found under every citation as a clickable Cited by N link. We seek to improve the PubMed search experience using two approaches. First, we request that PubMed add Cited by N links, making them as omnipresent as the GS links. Second, we created an open-source command-line tool, pmidcite, which is used alongside PubMed to give information to researchers to help with the choice of the next paper to examine, analogous to how GS's Cited by N links help to guide users.

  abstract = {Background: This article examines the problematic phenomenon of faculty assigning graduate health science students systematic reviews as semester-based assignments while expecting a health science librarian to be a willing support system for those students. Despite published conduct and reporting guidelines establishing that systematic reviews require a team, time, and methodological expertise, some faculty still turn to full systematic review assignments in the classroom. The authors propose applying cognitive load theory and chunking the systematic review process into manageable steps, allowing both faculty and students to better understand the required methodologies and to enhance educational outcomes. Experience: The authors have often been invited to visit classes where faculty have required students to complete a full systematic review. These assignments often result in frustration among faculty, librarians, and students stemming from the faculty's limited experience with the methodology and students feeling overwhelmed by the process. While the authors' experiences with suggesting the adaptable assignments to faculty is limited at the time of this publication, it is the hope of the authors that by sharing these concepts with other health science librarians, the trend of adapting more appropriate review assignments will expand. Discussion: Through applying cognitive load theory and chunking principles to simplify the systematic review process, the authors propose approaches to systematic review research methods that can improve the educational process, ameliorate faculty workload, and enhance student learning outcomes. As a result, students will be more prepared in future research endeavors. Challenges include faculty adoption and acceptance of different approaches to systematic review assignments, and a further burden on the librarians who support these types of assignments. Takeaways: The authors aim to raise faculty awareness of proper systematic review methodologies by offering alternative assignments that enhance student learning outcomes and alleviate the librarian's teaching burden. Initial attempts to promote these adaptations have shown promise, with some faculty successfully revising their syllabi and capstone projects to align with the suggested modifications. Future research will include webinars for faculty on systematic review methodologies, followed by ongoing evaluations of how these modifications impact the health science curriculum.},

  abstract = {Introduction Indigenous people experience a unique set of health inequalities and social determinants that can negatively affect their physical health, mental health and wellness. This critical state of affairs is compounded by the limited availability of culturally appropriate care services and treatments for the different groups. In response, increasing numbers of studies are turning their focus to art-based interventions and how these might benefit Indigenous lives. The proposed scoping review aims to map this growing field of research. Methods and analysis This scoping review is based on the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework and the subsequent enhancements proposed by Levac et al. Academic databases and grey literature sources will be searched to identify appropriate studies for inclusion. The search strategies of all databases were tested on 25 April 2024. This will be followed by a two-step screening process to be conducted by two researchers and consisting of (1) a title and abstract review and (2) a full-text review. Data from the selected studies will be extracted, collated and charted to summarise all relevant interventions, their outcomes and key findings. An Indigenous research partner will be hired as a consultant, and the research will be further informed by other stakeholders. Ethics and dissemination This study is the first step in a research programme involving working with Indigenous artists to codesign a pilot art-based intervention aimed at improving mental health and wellness among Indigenous people. The scoping review will identify the specific components in documented art-based interventions that have proven beneficial to this group. Since it will draw exclusively on data from published and public sources, no ethics approval is required. The results will be disseminated through knowledge translation activities with Indigenous organisations and art therapy groups; a summary of the results will also be distributed through Indigenous networks.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: As cities densify, researcher and policy focus is intensifying on which green space types and qualities are important for health. We conducted a systematic review to examine whether particular green space types and qualities have been shown to provide health benefits and if so, which specific types and qualities, and which health outcomes. (2) Methods: We searched five databases from inception up to June 30, 2021. We included all studies examining a wide range of green space characteristics on various health outcomes. (3) Results: 68 articles from 59 studies were found, with a high degree of heterogeneity in study designs, definitions of quality and outcomes. Most studies were cross-sectional, ecological or cohort studies. Environment types, vegetation types, and the size and connectivity of green spaces were associated with improved health outcomes, though with contingencies by age and gender. Health benefits were more consistently observed in areas with greater tree canopy, but not grassland. The main outcomes with evidence of health benefits included allergic respiratory conditions, cardiovascular conditions and psychological wellbeing. Both objectively and subjectively measured qualities demonstrated associations with health outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Experimental studies and longitudinal cohort studies will strengthen current evidence. Evidence was lacking for needs-specific or culturally-appropriate amenities and soundscape characteristics. Qualities that need more in-depth investigation include indices that account for forms, patterns, and networks of objectively and subjectively measured green space qualities.},

This systematic literature review examines the geographical landscape of the peer-reviewed literature on UPA and assesses its reported outcomes on sustainability and wellbeing. Following systematic review protocols, we undertook a two-step literature screening and quality assessment process. From a total of 4029 articles, based inclusion-exclusion criteria, we filtered 320 articles for quantitative and 86 for qualitative assessment. Quantitative analysis confirmed an exponential increase in literature on UPA since 2015 and a regional bias towards the Global North. The qualitative analysis identified six thematic outcomes of UPA under three sustainability pillars - environmental sustainability; material well-being; labour and livelihoods; land tenure and urban planning; and food and nutritional security as part of economic sustainability; and subjective and relational wellbeing as well as gender and social differentiation as elements of social sustainability. Environmental sustainability was most discussed, followed by subjective wellbeing and food and nutritional security. Gender and social differentiation issues were least represented in the papers. There remain knowledge gaps around how urban policy and planning can recognise, leverage, and scale up the sustainability and wellbeing co-benefits of UPA.}

  abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

LLD presents symptoms such as persistent low mood, decreased interest and pleasure, and feelings of worthlessness. Music therapy has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms in this population. However, understanding of its therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change remain limited. This scoping review aims to elucidate the therapeutic factors, mechanisms of change and their related outcomes involved in music therapy for people with LLD. Databases including Medline, Cinahl, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Selection criteria included elderly individuals (above 60), late-life depression, music therapy, therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change. Of 1249 screened studies, 31 were included, identifying 5 domains of presumed therapeutic factors, presumed mechanisms of change and related presumed outcomes. The domains are emotion, social, cognition, arousal and behavior \& motivation. The emotion domain, which encompasses presumed therapeutic factors and presumed mechanisms of change for emotion regulation emerged as the most prominent. Both music listening and interactive music making facilitate emotion regulation by evoking and expressing difficult feelings in people with LLD. Insights gained on therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change involved in music therapy for people with LLD can inform strategy development, enhance clinical care, and guide future research efforts.}

Information specialists and researchers took part in think-aloud tests, Hackathon and expert quality assessment in the period of April 2021 -- February 2022. Our observations point to a) opportunities in AI search to let go of traditional approaches to search and broaden our perception of how an academic search can be conducted, b) potential of AI search interfaces to challenge ones preconception and reduce cognitive bias in the search process, c) concerns about the quality of scientific literature AI search identifies, and d) barriers that need to be overcome before practical implementation of Ai search tools become viable in academic searches. More research is needed to show the usefulness of AI search tools in systematic search and guidance on how to report the use of them},
