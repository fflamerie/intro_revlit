  abstract = {Increased globalization, varying customer requirements, extended product lines, uncertainty regarding supplier performance, and myriad related factors make supply chains utterly complex. While previous research indicates that supply chain complexity plays an important role in explaining performance outcomes, the accumulating evidence is ambiguous. Thus, a finer-grained analysis is required. By meta-analyzing 27,668 observations across 102 independent samples from 123 empirical studies, we examine the link between supply chain complexity and firm performance. While the preponderance of evidence from previous studies identifies supply chain complexity as detrimental to firm performance, our results illustrate that although supply chain complexity has a negative effect on operational performance, it has a positive effect on innovation performance and financial performance. Furthermore, we also distinguish among different levels of supply chain (i.e., upstream, downstream, and internal) and observe nuanced findings. Finally, our findings also reveal moderating effects of construct operationalization and study design characteristics. We discuss implications for theory and practice and provide avenues for future research.},

However, a key unresolved issue is whether employee perceptions of HR strength act as a mediator or a moderator in the relationship between HR practices and these outcomes. A meta-analysis of 42 studies (comprising 65 samples and 29,444 unique participants) was conducted to address this issue. Results support the mediating hypothesis for all five employee outcomes: employee reactions, proactive behavior, burnout, performance, and perceived organizational effectiveness. Conversely, the moderating hypothesis was only supported for employee performance. In addition, we examined five study characteristics (the operationalization of perceived HR strength, research study design, industry, sampling strategy, and publication status) as moderators. Using this analysis, we test the robustness of our main results and identify sources of heterogeneity in the results across studies. The results show that the mediating hypothesis still holds under different study designs and contexts. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Modern nosologies (e.g., ICD-11, DSM-5) for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and dependence prioritize reliability and clinical presentation over etiology, resulting in a diagnosis that is not always strongly grounded in basic theory and research. Within these nosologies, DSM-5 AUD is treated as a discrete, largely categorical, but graded, phenomenon, which results in additional challenges (e.g., significant phenotypic heterogeneity). Efforts to increase the compatibility between AUD diagnosis and modern conceptualizations of alcohol dependence, which describe it as dimensional and partially overlapping with other psychopathology (e.g., other substance use disorders) will inspire a stronger scientific framework and strengthen AUD's validity. We conducted a systematic review of 144 reviews to integrate addiction constructs and theories into a comprehensive framework with the aim of identifying fundamental mechanisms implicated in AUD. The product of this effort was the Etiologic, Theory-Based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical Framework (ETOH Framework) of AUD mechanisms, which outlines superdomains of cognitive control, reward, as well as negative valence and emotionality, each of which subsume narrower, hierarchically-organized components. We also outline opponent processes and self-awareness as key moderators of AUD mechanisms. In contrast with other frameworks, we recommend an increased conceptual role for negative valence and compulsion in AUD. The ETOH framework serves as a critical step towards conceptualizations of AUD as dimensional and heterogeneous. It has the potential to improve AUD assessment and aid in the development of evidence-based diagnostic measures that focus on key mechanisms in AUD, consequently facilitating treatment matching.},

Using a quantitative approach, we selected a random Crossref sample of more than 115,000 records, which was then searched in seven databases (Dimensions, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, OpenAlex, Scilit, Semantic Scholar, and The Lens). Seven characteristics were analyzed (abstract, access, bibliographic info, document type, publication date, language, and identifiers), to observe fields that describe this information, the completeness rate of these fields, and the agreement among databases. The results show that academic search engines (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Semantic Scholar) gather less information and have a low degree of completeness. Conversely, third-party databases (Dimensions, OpenAlex, Scilit, and The Lens) have more metadata quality and a higher completeness rate. We conclude that academic search engines lack the ability to retrieve reliable descriptive data by crawling the web, and the main problem of third-party databases is the loss of information derived from integrating different sources.}

Quantitative methods were dominantly employed, and the majority were conducted in China. The conceptual focus of the studies highlighted two key areas: emotion regulation and emotional labour. The primary research focus was found to be affective factors in the workplace. The findings of conceptual analyses on the workplace outcomes revealed five themes at both levels, namely, leadership and management, organisational climate and support, cultural and diversity considerations, teacher development, and classroom and interaction dynamics consisting of similar and distinctive codes.},

Therefore, this study evaluates the citation coverage of the citation indices of 59 databases, encompassing the widely used Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science alongside many others never previously analyzed, such as the emerging Lens, Scite, Dimensions, and OpenAlex or the subject-specific PubMed and JSTOR. Through a comprehensive analysis using 259 journal articles from across disciplines, this research aims to guide scholars in selecting indices with broader document coverage and more accurate and comprehensive backward and forward citation links. Key findings highlight Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Semantic Scholar, and Lens as leading options for FWC searching, with Lens providing superior download capabilities. For BWC searching, the Web of Science Core Collection can be recommended over Scopus for accuracy. BWC information from publisher databases such as IEEE Xplore or ScienceDirect was generally found to be the most accurate, yet only available for a limited number of articles. The findings will help scholars conducting systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and bibliometric analyses to select the most suitable databases for citation searching.},

Analyzing 404 SLRs and MAs from top-tier management-related journals and the 135 methodological studies on which they relied revealed significant opportunities to improve sampling quality. We found that inadequate guidance and an overreliance on unfounded ``best practices'' often leads to suboptimal search strategies and incomplete reporting. To improve literature sampling, we have developed a guide that details four sequenced and prioritized scoping, searching, screening, and reporting steps. The guide also includes recommendations for the most suitable literature databases to search with, suggested (AI-enabled) tool support, and two checks to validate the effectiveness of search strategies. We created this guide by adapting the state-of-the-art recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA---the widely acknowledged benchmarks in methodical and reporting guidance---and supplementing them with additional evidence-based methodological insights. By adopting the guide, authors can ensure their sampling is effective and meets the high standards of SLRs and MAs, thereby likely boosting the impact of their review. The guide is applicable to all review types that require comprehensive, transparent, and reproducible sampling, including bibliometric studies and integrative reviews.},

The COVID-19 pandemic shows us the boundaries of academic searching capabilities, both in terms of our know-how and of the systems we have. With hundreds of studies published daily on COVID-19, for example, we struggle to find, stay up-to-date, and synthesize information---all hampering evidence-informed decision making. This COVID-19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the ``Search Triangle'' model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit-for-purpose search systems.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to reviewing literature may be susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a `critical friend' role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the `systematic review' label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions.},

Rigorous searching methods are vital for reliable, repeatable and unbiased searches needed for these second and third forms of searches (exploratory and systematic searching, respectively) that form a core part of evidence syntheses. Despite the broad awareness of the importance of transparency in reporting search activities in evidence syntheses, the importance of searching has been highlighted only recently and has been the explicit focus of reporting guidance (PRISMA-S). Ensuring bibliographic searches are reported in a way that is transparent enough to allow for full repeatability or evaluation is challenging for a number of reasons. Here, we detail these reasons and provide for the first time a standardised data structure for transparent and comprehensive reporting of search histories. This data structure was produced by a group of international experts in informatics and library sciences. We explain how the data structure was produced and describe its components in detail. We also demonstrate its practical applicability in tools designed to support literature review authors and explain how it can help to improve interoperability across tools used to manage literature reviews. We call on the research community and developers of reference and review management tools to embrace the data structure to facilitate adequate reporting of academic searching in an effort to raise the standard of evidence syntheses globally.},

  abstract = {Literature reviews are conducted for a range of purposes, from providing an overview or primer of a novel topic, to providing a comprehensive, precise, and accurate estimate of an effect estimate. There is much confusion over nomenclature related to literature reviews, with the term `systematic review' often used to mean any review based on some form of explicit methodology. However, guidance and minimum standards exist for these kinds of robust reviews that are intended to support evidence-informed decision-making, and reviewers must carefully ensure their syntheses are conducted and reported to a high standard if this is their objective. The diversity of names given to reviews is reflected in the diversity of methods used for these evidence syntheses: the result is a general confusion about what is important to ensure a review is fit-for-purpose, and many reviews are labelled as `systematic reviews' when they do not follow standardised or replicable approaches. Here, we provide a glossary or typology that aims to highlight the importance of the reviewers' objectives in choosing and naming their review method. We focus on reviews in public health and provide guidance on selecting an objective, methodological guidance to follow, justifying and reporting the methods chosen, and attempting to ensure consistent and clear nomenclature. We hope this will help review authors, editors, peer-reviewers, and readers understand, interpret, and critique a review depending on its intended use. {\copyright} Author(s) 2022.},

However, awareness of these risks is low, and comprehensive studies outlining these hazards and their impacts on railways are also scarce. To address these gaps, this review aims to identify climate-related risks, clarify the hazard-impact relationships and risk interconnections, and explore strategies to account for the influence of climate change on these risks. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted in two stages. First, 71 peer-reviewed papers were collected through developing search strings, applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, and performing backward/forward citation searches. Second, the required information was systematically extracted from the papers and critically analyzed to address the research objectives. As a result, 24 climate hazards and 29 associated impacts were identified and categorized. The hazards and impacts having the most and least occurrence in the literature were also highlighted. Informative matrices were developed to correlate hazards with impacts and illustrate the cascading effects of the impacts. Four distinct approaches used to address the effects of climate change on climate risks were identified and critically discussed. The study also highlights critical gaps in the literature to guide future research.}

Beyond the traditional study of their perceptions and attitudes, they are also active agents whose behaviours influence the image of the destination and the satisfaction of tourists. To date, some outstanding works have reviewed the existing literature on residents' perceptions of tourism impacts and residents' attitudes toward tourism. However, no other review studies have addressed the resident pro-tourism behaviour issue with the specific aim of developing a conceptual framework. This study aims to address this gap through a systematic review (following the PRISMA protocol) to identify and classify residents' behaviours towards tourism and, to analyse the scales used to measure these behaviours. Theoretical insights from the results include: a classification of residents' pro-tourism behaviours; a focus on measuring active, favourable behaviours, with varying emphasis on other specific behaviours; and a merely testimonial presence of quantitative studies measuring anti-tourism behaviours. From a practical standpoint, tourism managers should recognise that residents' behaviours toward tourism can vary depending on the destination and the degree of resident-tourist interaction. From a social perspective, understanding residents' behaviour is essential for achieving balanced and sustainable tourism development.},

  abstract = {Objective: Systematic reviews and other evidence synthesis projects require systematic search methods. Search systems require several essential attributes to support systematic searching; however, many systems used in evidence synthesis fail to meet one or more of these requirements. I undertook a qualitative study to examine the effects of these limitations on systematic searching and how searchers select information sources for evidence synthesis projects. Methods: Qualitative data were collected from interviews with twelve systematic searchers. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: I used thematic analysis to identify two key themes relating to search systems: systems shape search processes, and systematic searching occurs within the information market. Many systems required for systematic reviews, in particular sources of unpublished studies, are not designed for systematic searching. Participants described various workarounds for the limitations they encounter in these systems. Economic factors influence searchers' selection of sources to search, as well as the degree to which vendors prioritize these users. Conclusion: Interviews with systematic searchers suggest priorities for improving search systems, and barriers to improvement that must be overcome. Vendors must understand the unique requirements of systematic searching and recognize systematic searchers as a distinct group of users. Better interfaces and improved functionality will result in more efficient evidence synthesis.},

Beyond term based searching in electronic databases, citation searching is a prevalent search technique to identify relevant sources of evidence. However, for decades, citation searching methodology and terminology has not been standardised. An evidence guided, four round Delphi consensus study was conducted with 27 international methodological experts in order to develop the Terminology, Application, and Reporting of Citation Searching (TARCiS) statement. TARCiS comprises 10 specific recommendations, each with a rationale and explanation on when and how to conduct and report citation searching in the context of systematic literature searches. The statement also presents four research priorities, and it is hoped that systematic review teams are encouraged to incorporate TARCiS into standardised workflows.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Deduplication methods for multiple database searches conducted for evidence syntheses differ in terms of time invested, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of identified duplicates. Deduplication tools can significantly contribute to a more efficient conduct of the search task in evidence syntheses. Widely-used tools for deduplication include reference management software (e.g. EndNote), built-in deduplication features in systematic review software (e.g. Covidence, Rayyan), and automated deduplication tools (e.g. Deduklick, SRA Deduplicator). Newer tools leverage machine learning algorithms crafted by information specialists, that encompass natural language normalization and rule-based approaches. We investigated five frequently used automated and semi-automated deduplication tools regarding their performance, core features and time efficiency in comparison to manual deduplication in EndNote using six datasets.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable interest in urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) in recent decades, its contributions to urban sustainability and human wellbeing remain contested. This systematic literature review examines the geographical landscape of the peer-reviewed literature on UPA and assesses its reported outcomes on sustainability and wellbeing. Following systematic review protocols, we undertook a two-step literature screening and quality assessment process. From a total of 4029 articles, based inclusion-exclusion criteria, we filtered 320 articles for quantitative and 86 for qualitative assessment. Quantitative analysis confirmed an exponential increase in literature on UPA since 2015 and a regional bias towards the Global North. The qualitative analysis identified six thematic outcomes of UPA under three sustainability pillars - environmental sustainability; material well-being; labour and livelihoods; land tenure and urban planning; and food and nutritional security as part of economic sustainability; and subjective and relational wellbeing as well as gender and social differentiation as elements of social sustainability. Environmental sustainability was most discussed, followed by subjective wellbeing and food and nutritional security. Gender and social differentiation issues were least represented in the papers. There remain knowledge gaps around how urban policy and planning can recognise, leverage, and scale up the sustainability and wellbeing co-benefits of UPA.}

  abstract = {Due to the growing aging population, the number of people with late-life depression (LLD) is estimated to increase significantly. LLD presents symptoms such as persistent low mood, decreased interest and pleasure, and feelings of worthlessness. Music therapy has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms in this population. However, understanding of its therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change remain limited. This scoping review aims to elucidate the therapeutic factors, mechanisms of change and their related outcomes involved in music therapy for people with LLD. Databases including Medline, Cinahl, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Selection criteria included elderly individuals (above 60), late-life depression, music therapy, therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change. Of 1249 screened studies, 31 were included, identifying 5 domains of presumed therapeutic factors, presumed mechanisms of change and related presumed outcomes. The domains are emotion, social, cognition, arousal and behavior \& motivation. The emotion domain, which encompasses presumed therapeutic factors and presumed mechanisms of change for emotion regulation emerged as the most prominent. Both music listening and interactive music making facilitate emotion regulation by evoking and expressing difficult feelings in people with LLD. Insights gained on therapeutic factors and mechanisms of change involved in music therapy for people with LLD can inform strategy development, enhance clinical care, and guide future research efforts.}
